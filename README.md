# :purple_heart: __[Beauty Colors Generator](https://liarleycodie.github.io/Beauty-Colors-Generator/)__ :purple_heart:

:relieved: Well, this is the first of others 20 projects which i am are working for improve my javascript skills. I passed around 1,5 days for finish. In the end, i liked the result as well the colors itself generated by this project. If someone are viewing this project, :+1: i hope its useful to you. :)

:thought_balloon: I think that interface very simple. Therefore, i thought which i would don't need to explain how it works... Right? :mushroom: __But__, if you don't know what to do:

- In top of the page, the buttons `Text`, `RGB` and `HEX` will indicate the type of color value which will be generated. You can choose one, two or all.
- For generate the color (or a new color), just click in `New Color` button in the center of the page.
- The button on the side of _New Color_, called `Copy to Clipboard` will quickly copy the color value to clipboard area. So, you only would need to press `CTRL+V` to paste the value.

> :christmas_tree: When all three (or two) buttons in top are activated, the value generated will be, randomly, one between the three types (or text, or rgb or hex)
